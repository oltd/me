This site will be a new experiment for me, in order to take blogging a bit more serious than in previou
attempts. I found a new very short username, that luckly is not taken on the main platforms I use (like GitHub).
Twitter actually requires more than 4 characters as an username, but nothing I can do about that.

Having the opportunity to start from the ground up, I decided to look for a new blogging platform. In previous
attempts I used Jekyll or Hugo. Both great platforms, but I felt kinda stuck when I used them or everything was too restricted.
Zola is something I found through HackerNews and I kept the tab open until I found the time to start this site. Writte in Rust,
many options for custimization (but in a simple, not complicated way) and easy to get started with.

I'll update this post over and over during my journey with zola. But for now, I'll just provide some links:

- the theme I use [`dose`](https://github.com/oltd/dose)
- zola itself [on Github](https://github.com/getzola/zola) or [their site](https://www.getzola.org/)
